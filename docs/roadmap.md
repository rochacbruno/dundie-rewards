## Commands

- `load`
- `show`
- `add`
- `transfer`
- `history`

## Password protection

All the commands will require e-mail and password, and then will
check on the `users` table to validate the authentication.

## Role Based Access Control

Users that has `admin` = `True` on the `users` table will be able to
run the commands:  `load`, `add` for other users  access is denied.

The `show` command will allow filtering by `dept` and `email` for admins
but for other users will default to `--email=user_email` so the user
can see only his own report.

The `transfer` command will allow user to send points from his own account
to any other and will be password protected.

The `history` command allow user to see his own movements, admin users can
pass `--email=` and see anyone else movements.
